/*
Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substring such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".*/
